Key Components

1. APISocialHub (WhatsApp API Integration)

Handles WhatsApp message dispatch with validations for preview, error handling, and success logging. It integrates seamlessly with the backend to automate message workflows for the registered leads and phone numbers.

2. APICrmGraphQL

Developed using Graphene, this custom GraphQL API allows for flexible CRUD operations on leads and messages. It serves as the primary interface for data retrieval and modification within the WhatsLab system, making it highly scalable and open for integration with external systems.

3. DataWrestler

A powerful internal data processing component that merges and processes data from multiple sources (leads, appointments, message logs) to produce a unified, actionable dataset. DataWrestler is responsible for optimizing lead engagement strategies by ensuring the data is complete and accurate.

4. LeadGen

A dynamic landing page generator that captures leads from multiple sources and injects them directly into the CRM‚Äôs workflow. It allows for customizable landing pages based on different lead sources and marketing campaigns, automatically integrating with APISocialHub for message dispatch.

How It Works

	1.	Message Management: Admins can create, edit, and delete personalized messages that will be sent to leads via the WhatsApp API.
	2.	Phone Number Registration: Users can register their phone numbers and tokens, which are securely stored and used for message dispatch.
	3.	Lead Management: Admins can upload leads via CSV files or dynamically capture them via landing pages. These leads are automatically integrated into message workflows.
	4.	Automated Message Sending: Once a lead is in the system, APISocialHub takes over and ensures that messages are delivered based on the preset campaign rules.
	5.	Data Processing: DataWrestler processes and merges lead data from various sources, allowing for real-time analysis and optimized message dispatch.
